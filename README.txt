NOTE - This is more of a look at this script and adapt it to your needs script 

This script will read in 2 files and run the RNA seq pipeline - 

1. Groups file - a file with 3 tab separated columns with the ofllowing format -
   
   Group_name Reads1  Reads2

   where :- 
   Group_name = Any group/class that the sample belongs to eg Case or Control
   Reads1/2   = Fastq files for the paired end reads (single end functionalit is somehwat there but needs to be worked on)

2. Comparisons file - this file contains 2 tab separated columns containing the names of the groups you want to compare together, one group on each line 
   eg. 
   Case1 Control
   Case2 Control
   Case1 Case2

   This will be used by the DESeq function in the script and it'll write and execute an R script to do the differential expression analysis between the groups
   This does not use DESeq2 which is the newer version so you can just comment out this part in the main() to not run it and just use the counts file generated by the script
   
   At some point I might add DESeq2 and even add an option to do custom modelling


Arguments needed -

1/ Directory where the data is
2/ Output directory
3/ Groups file 
4/ Comparisons file
5/ A 5th optional argument to add an identifier in your file names

Currently there are two protocols in it -

main() - Use this if you have prepared your library using the generic protocol
main_smarter() - Use this if you have used the Smarter protocol to prepare the libraries

The differences are in the way adapers are removed
